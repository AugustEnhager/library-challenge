## Library Challenge
### Week 1 Ruby challenge

Team: August and Max   

Due date: Monday 6/9

### The Code
Our code simulates a library through the use of two Ruby classes. One class is the library itself, and the other is a person who wants to borrow books at the library. The library catalogue is maintained in a YAML data file.

### Dependencies
Rspec for testing, Pry and Pry-byebug for debugging. Coveralls for magic...

### Setup
You can run `git clone https://github.com/AugustEnhager/library-challenge.git` in your terminal to download a copy of this repo (provided you have git installed).

Then `cd` into your new `library-challenge` directory.

If you don't have `pry`, `pry-byebug`, `rspec`, `coveralls` installed you may need to run `bundle install` (or equivalent if you are using something other than Bundler).

Feel free to run `rspec` to see the output of our tests in your terminal.
